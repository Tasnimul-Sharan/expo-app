// To send the code to Firebase, you don't directly send the code to Firebase itself. Instead, you implement the code within your ASP.NET application, and the application communicates with Firebase through the Firebase Admin SDK.

// Here are the steps to integrate the code with Firebase:

// Set up a Firebase project: Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project or select an existing project.

// Add Firebase to your ASP.NET project: In your ASP.NET project, add the FirebaseAdmin SDK NuGet package. You can do this by right-clicking on your project in Visual Studio and selecting "Manage NuGet Packages." Search for "FirebaseAdmin" and install the package.

// Download the service account key: In the Firebase Console, go to your project's settings and navigate to the "Service Accounts" tab. Click on "Generate New Private Key" to download a JSON file that contains your service account key.

// Initialize the Firebase app: In your ASP.NET application, call the InitializeFirebaseApp() method to initialize the Firebase app. Replace the "path/to/serviceAccountKey.json" with the actual path to the service account key file you downloaded.

// Implement the desired messaging functionality: Use the provided code snippets (topic-based messaging or device-to-device messaging) within your ASP.NET application. Modify the code as needed, such as customizing the notification title, body, and target recipients.

// Deploy and run your ASP.NET application: Deploy your ASP.NET application to a hosting environment that supports running ASP.NET applications. This could be a web server or a cloud hosting platform.

// Test and monitor: Once your application is deployed and running, you can test the messaging functionality by triggering the appropriate methods from your application. Monitor the Firebase Console and logs to ensure that the messages are being sent successfully.

// Remember to handle exceptions and errors appropriately within your code and refer to the official Firebase documentation for any updates or additional guidance specific to the Firebase Admin SDK for C# ASP.NET and Firebase Cloud Messaging.

// Note: It's important to secure the service account key file and avoid exposing it publicly or including it in your source code repository.
